# A Simple Frame For Showcasing Content

## Project Variables
GATEWAY_URL=Your Pinata Gateway

PROJECT_URL=Your Server URL

FOLDER_CID=The CID hash that you want to showcase in your frame.

PINATA_JWT=This is your Pinata JWT that will be used so you can get frame analytics on your frame.

WARPCAST_URL=After casting to Warpcast put your Warpcast url of your cast. On the project URL you will
have a link that will go to the frame, so users don't have to backtrack when click on the wrong link.

## How your folder should be set up and pinned in Pinata:
    1. Make sure all images in the folder are named sequentially. (mc1.jpg, mc2.jpg, mc3.jpg, mc4.jpg.....) 
    2. Upload your folder to Pinata.
